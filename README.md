> [!WARNING]
> g0efilter is in active development and its configuration may change often.

g0efilter is a lightweight container designed to filter outbound (egress) traffic from attached container workloads. Run g0efilter alongside your workloads and attach them to its network namespace to enforce a simple IP and domain allowlist policy.

### How it works

* Attach containers to g0efilter using `network_mode: "service:g0efilter"` in Docker Compose.
* A policy file defines the allowed IPs/CIDRs and domains.
* Using nftables, g0efilter (when in SNI filter mode) allows traffic to specified IPs/CIDRs or redirects outbound HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) to local services.
* These local services check the HTTP Host header or TLS SNI extension in the ClientHello and allow or block connections according to the policy.  
* Filtering behaviour depends on the selected mode: sni (default) or dns.  
* The optional g0efilter-dashboard displays real-time traffic and enforcement actions.

> [!NOTE]
> Attached containers share g0efilterâ€™s network namespace.  
> g0efilter listens on `HTTP_PORT` (default `8080`) and `HTTPS_PORT` (default `8443`) for inspection.  
> Avoid binding these ports in attached containers or change them via environment variables.

### SNI/Host Header filtering behaviour (default)

* All IPs listed in the policy file bypass any redirection.
* In SNI mode (default), traffic to ports 80 and 443 is redirected to local services that check the HTTP Host header or TLS SNI against the policy file, anything not matching is blocked by nftables.

### DNS filtering behaviour

* All IPs listed in the policy file bypass any redirection.
* In DNS mode, traffic to port 53 is redirected to an internal DNS server that only resolves domains that match the policy. Non-policy domains simply fail to resolve, but direct IP connections are allowed (no default deny), so this mode can potentially be bypassed.

### Dashboard container

The optional **g0efilter-dashboard** container runs a small web UI on **port 8081** (by default). If `DASHBOARD_HOST` and `DASHBOARD_API_KEY` are set, the **g0efilter** container will ship logs to the dashboard.

## Dashboard Reverse Proxy Suggestion

I would recommended to place the **g0efilter-dashboard** behind a reverse proxy such as Traefik with the following controls:

**Public Endpoints (no authentication required):**
- `GET /health` - Health check endpoint for monitoring/load balancers

**API Key Protected Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/v1/logs` - Log ingestion from g0efilter containers (protected by `API_KEY` environment variable)

**SSO/Authentication Protected Endpoints:**
- `GET /` - Dashboard web UI
- `GET /api/v1/logs` - Read logs
- `GET /api/v1/events` - Server-Sent Events stream
- `DELETE /api/v1/logs` - Clear logs
- All other dashboard routes

**Example Configuration Pattern:**

Configure your reverse proxy to:
1. Allow `/health` publicly for health checks
2. Bypass SSO/OIDC middleware for `POST /api/v1/logs` (allows g0efilter containers to authenticate with API key instead)
3. Require SSO/OIDC middleware for all other routes (UI and read operations)

This ensures:
- g0efilter containers can ship logs using the API key
- Dashboard UI access is protected by some sort of auth middleware (eg PocketID, Authelia, Authentik etc).
- Monitoring systems can check health without authentication
- Unauthorized users cannot view sensitive traffic logs

### Example Traefik Configuration

If using Traefik as a reverse proxy, here's an example of a working yaml based configuration using two routers to handle different authentication requirements:

```yaml
http:
  routers:
    g0efilter-ingest-router:
      entryPoints:
        - websecure
      rule: "Host(`g0efilter.example.com`) && ((PathPrefix(`/api/v1/logs`) && Method(`POST`)) || PathPrefix(`/health`))"
      service: g0efilter-dash-service
      middlewares:
        - security-headers
        - ratelimit
      tls:
        certResolver: letsencrypt
        domains:
          - main: "example.com"
            sans:
              - "*.example.com"

    g0efilter-dash-router:
      entryPoints:
        - websecure
      rule: "Host(`g0efilter.example.com`)"
      service: g0efilter-dash-service
      middlewares:
        - security-headers
        - ratelimit
        - auth-oidc  # Your auth middleware
      tls:
        certResolver: letsencrypt
        domains:
          - main: "example.com"
            sans:
              - "*.example.com"

  services:
    g0efilter-dash-service:
      loadBalancer:
        servers:
          - url: "http://g0efilter-dashboard:8081"
```

**How it works:**
- `g0efilter-ingest-router`: Matches `POST /api/v1/logs` and `/health` - no SSO required
- `g0efilter-dash-router`: Matches all other requests to the dashboard - requires SSO/OIDC authentication
- The more specific ingest router rule takes precedence for API calls and health checks
- All other traffic (UI, reads, etc.) goes through the dashboard router with SSO protection


### Example docker-compose.yaml

```yaml
services:
  g0efilter:
    image: docker.io/g0lab/g0efilter:latest
    container_name: g0efilter
    volumes:
      - ./policy.yaml:/app/policy.yaml:ro
    cap_drop:
      - ALL
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN # Required for nftables modification
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges
    # Host-exposed port for dashboard (dashboard runs in same netns)
    ports:
      - 8081:8081 # Dashboard port
    read_only: true
    restart: always
    env_file:
      - .env

  g0efilter-dashboard:
    image: docker.io/g0lab/g0efilter-dashboard:latest
    container_name: g0efilter-dashboard
    # optional - custom user
    # user: 1000:1000
    cap_drop:
      - ALL
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges
    read_only: true
    env_file:
      - .env.dashboard
    network_mode: "service:g0efilter"
    restart: always
    depends_on: [g0efilter]

  example-container:
    image: alpine:latest
    container_name: example-container
    command: >
      sh -c "apk add --no-cache curl && tail -f /dev/null"
    network_mode: "service:g0efilter"
    depends_on: [g0efilter]
